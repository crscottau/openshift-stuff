Security Information and Event Management
Notifications of ACS policy violations can be forwarded to the SIEM to a HTTP endpoint or via a webhook. Policy violations must be individually set to be forwarded to the SIEM. ACS administrators can monitor the ACS console and decide to forward notification of a particular policy violation. Additionally, Splunk has an ACS plugin that can scrape security events and notifications from ACS.
Audit logs from both OpenShift and ACS can be forwarded directly to a log collector or SIEM endpoint. Note however that these are just raw audit logs, any interpretation of these must be configured in the receiver.
